file names

trainfile : training data
testfile : test data
trainheader : train label data
testheader : test label data
features_labels : file containing features name
activilty_labels : file containing activity text labels
sub_trainfile : file for subject numbers for training observations
sub_testfile : file for subject numbers for test observations

variables

totalset : contains joined train and test observations
totalhead : contains joined labels for train and test observations
totalsub : contains joined list of subjects from train and test observations
cols : it keeps the features columns names and numbers
cols_numbers : stores columns numbers to keep based in the criteria of features that only contains mean and standard deviation observations
cols_names: it keeps the column names that only contains mean and standard deviation observations. These are used to give descriptive name to each feature
averageset : stores the final result grouped by activity and subject with average value of all features for each group.

transformations

totalset with all features is filtered based on the given columns for mean and std values. 
totalhead is the values transformed to text label by doing a lookup of values of total_labels into activity_labels dataframe
totalset is prepared by doing column bind of observations, activity labels and subject numbers
name of columns in totalset are replaced as provided in cols_names
averages is obtained by using dplyr library and chaining the functions groupby and summarize_all
